## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Below is the code which make me tired to fixed it, because the different width and the effect it gives to the interface from different devices, but yes i did it.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```html
<div class="container px-6 mx-auto my-10 sm:my-28 sm:px-50 sm:flex xl:px-48 2xl:px-60"></div>
```
